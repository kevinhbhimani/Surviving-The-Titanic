Surviving The Titanic

Authors: Kevin H. Bhimani and Trevor W. Stephens

In our final project for COMP 562, we decided to use a dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) to see if we could develop and compare two different machine learning algorithms and their effectiveness at predicting the survival of individual passengers from the Titanic. In this project, we used both logistic regression and Gaussian naive to develop two distinct models for predicting the survival of Titanic passengers. 

In this project, we had two goals. The first was to compare the effectiveness of these two techniques (logistic regression and Gaussian naive Bayes) on this kind of data, and the second was to use the better model to determine what predictors best helped a passenger survive the Titanic. We did this in order to compare multiple models that we have learned this year. This class has taught us several techniques for developing machine learning models, but we wanted the opportunity to compare some of them ourselves and see what areas they excel in and fall behind.

We first looked into what other people have developed on the subject of predicting Titanic survival for individual passengers, and found a project by a pair of students at Brown (http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs100/students/project28/). These students made a number of plots in an attempt to draw some conclusions about the impact of many of attributes on the survival rate of passengers on the Titanic. They concluded that women and children have the best chance of surviving, and that the class of the passenger actually does not impact the survival rate for passengers once other variables are taken into account. They also found that the point of embarkment for each passenger was impactful in a passenger’s survival rate. While these students do try to take multiple variables into account in their analysis, they neither utilize any machine learning techniques, nor develop any simple models, and therefore we believe that we can improve upon their findings. 

During the development of our two models, we used seven different predictors to predict if a passenger survived.
Pclass - The class of the ticket purchased by the passenger. 1 = 1st class, 2 = 2nd class, 3 = 3rd class
Sex - The sex of the passenger. 1.0 = male, 2.0 = female
Age - The sex of the passenger. 1.0 = male, 2.0 = female
Parch - The number of parents and children that a passenger had on the Titanic with them.
Ticket - The ticket number on the ticket that was sold to the passenger.
Fare - The price that the passenger bought their ticket for.
Embarked - The port at which the passenger embarked. C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton
And our response variable is Survived, which is a 1 if the passenger survived the trip and a 0 if the passenger did not survive the trip. For variables, such as sex, ticket and embarked, we assigned numerical value in order to incorporate them into our model.

We then created and analyzed our two models. We decided upon logistic regression and Gaussian naive Bayes in order to compare and contrast two different machine learning methods. Both are used for classification problems like this one, but they have differences. Gaussian naive Bayes is generative and logistic regression is discriminatory, and using this common dataset for both can allow us to compare and contrast the two methods. We first trained these two models on some training data, and then tests the results on our test data. 

These results show us some simple information about our models, such as that the logistic model was more accurate overall, but this could be misleading. The logistic model could have been more accurate than the Gaussian model without actually predicting the results for individual passengers more accurately. For example, in a group of six passengers, the logistic model could have said that three survived and three died, while in reality the opposite three survived and died. Because of this problem we need to look more closely into the data. After looking more closely at the data, the logistic model correctly predicted the fates for 308 passengers out of 331, and the Gaussian model did so for 281 out of 331 total passengers. This means that the logistic model was accurate 93 percent of the time and the Gaussian model was accurate 85 percent of the time. Both models seem to be fairly accurate, which is good to see. These results also confirm that the logistic model is better at predicting the fates of Titanic passengers.

After confirming that the logistic model is more accurate than the Gaussian model, we then wanted to look at what kind of inaccurate predictions we were getting from our models. We did this to analyze if our models produced more false positives or false negatives. 

We can see that both of our models produce more false positives than false negatives. This is interesting to note, and especially concerning because less than half of people actually survived the Titanic, meaning that our models should be producing more false negatives than false positives. While this overpredicting of survival is initially concerning, it could have a logical explanation. Since most people on the Titanic died, it could easily be true that a significant group of people, who based on their predictor variable values “should” have survived, but actually died due to circumstances not related to who got to get on lifeboats first. This would explain large groups of people that the models would most likely predict to survive but actually died.

Since we have concluded that the logistic model is more accurate than the Gaussian Model, we can begin to analyze which predictors are most impactful in the survival of a Titanic passenger. From our logistic model, we can see the beta values for each predictor.

From our beta values, we can identify which predictors are the most impactful. The beta values for both Pclass and Sex are the most impactful, showcasing that the best things to be on the Titanic was poor and female. The gender conclusion matches the conclusion from the Brown students, but our conclusions do disagree with their conclusion that class is not impactful after accounting for other variables.

In conclusion, this project has determined that a logistic regression model is better than a Gaussian naive Bayes model for predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic. This could mean that a logistic regression model is better at other similar classification problems. We also concluded that the class of ticket purchased and the sex of the passenger were the most important predictors in determining a passenger’s chance of survival. Similar methods might be applied to similar problems, such as predicting what passengers on a cruise ship are most likely to get sick. In that case, some similar predictors would exist and the result would still be about health. Also, cruise ships use personal cards and the account for each passenger, allowing them to collect a large amount of data that could be used by a model to determine the risk of a passenger getting sick onboard.
